# Ember_DB

All contents of Ember's SQL and database are in this zip file.

One SQL file is inside the zipped file but is far too large to commit here, so the zip file was created.

run
7z x EmberDBCleanExport.7z

and then in your SQL command line, use the source command on the file to apply it to your database.

Enjoy!
